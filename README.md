A Basic C Project
*****************************************************************************************
This is a very basic project in C language which works on the concept of file management
and other basic functionalities. Here is a text file of the code which you will need to
compile in a C compiler and then execute the file.

Moreover, a text file named ID.txt needs to be placed in the folder where you are having
the executable file of the project. ID.txt is already provided in the repository.
