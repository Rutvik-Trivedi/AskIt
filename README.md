# AskIt
A Basic C Project
*****************************************************************************************
This is a very basic project in C language which works on the concept of file management
and other basic functionalities. Here is a text file of the code which you will need to
compile in a C compiler and then execute the file.

Moreover, you will need to take all the files from Files directory and place it in the
location of the executable file for the smooth working of the project.

A .exe file is also provided to download and run directly. For this you will also need
the 'Files' directory in the same directory as the AskIt.exe file for the program to run
perfectly. So, download both the exe file and the Files directory in the same folder and
the program is ready to run.
